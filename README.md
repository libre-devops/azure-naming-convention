# Azure Naming Convention

Hello :wave: and welcome to an example of an Azure naming convention which follows the [Recommended Microsoft abbreviations](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/cloud-adoption-framework/blob/main/docs/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations.md), fully implemented in  terraform-compliance in the `az-terraform-compliance-policy` folder :smile:.

This repo hosts the files needed to run a standard name and tagging policy check on your terraform code.

In the future, the project would like to host Azure policy for the same thing, [as soon as they support regex](https://andrewmatveychuk.com/how-to-enforce-naming-convention-for-azure-resources/#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20Azure%20policy%20currently%20doesn,specific%20list%20of%20match%20conditions.) :sweat_smile:

## Why?
You probably found this repo looking to implement something similar for your own company, so please feel free to use this version!  

[Microsoft says](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging): Accurately representing and naming your resources is essential for security purposes. If you come upon a security incident, it's critical to quickly identify affected systems, what functions those systems support, and the potential business impact. Security services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel reference resources and their associated logging and alert information by resource name.

Azure defines naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources. This guidance provides you with detailed recommendations to support enterprise cloud adoption efforts.

Changing resource names can be difficult. Establish a comprehensive naming convention before you begin any large cloud deployment.

but why `terraform-compliance`?

Terraform-Compliance follows a pattern of [Behavior-driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), where tests should be written to follow a pattern at the beginning of development.  In enterprise cloud, naming your resources in a consistent manner is very important for readability and auditing.  This type of policy can be brought in house and tweaked for each organisation, and can be enabled in your CI/CD piepline for continuous compliance :wink:.

This repo:

- Hosts a main copy for community to collaborate and add services for Azure in terraform-compliance 
- Follows [Microsoft's recommended abbrevations for Azure resource types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations) :rainbow:
- Is free, open source and can be used by anyone!


## Things you will need

- Azure :smile:
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [terraform-compliance](https://terraform-compliance.com/)
  - And everything needed to run it!
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

You should consult the terraform-compliance docs on how you want to deploy these files, but they can be used with remote fetching and ran locally too.


## Contributing

This list is non-exhaustive, there is 100s of resources in Azure and not all will be covered, and we will be adding these as I go along. Some you may disagree with or need changing for your own org, so you are free to use this copy, clone it and change it or even fork it if you need greater customisation! If you want to add something then please see contribution guide below!

Another note, this naming convention tries to cover parts of the API which you cannot make with Terraform, so in those occurrences, `terraform-compliance` won't have a test for these.  To save confusion and for all the ARM/Bicep/Pulumi users, we have added the resource entity API names to the naming convention so it can be clear even things which can't be controlled with terraform can have a name assigned.

To contribute to the main copy:

- Create a branch against main or raise an issue on GitHub :exclamation:
- Raise a pull-request with your resources.
- If it fits the current pattern, it will be merged :bomb:

# Resource Name Construction

As a general rule, all names should try to exclude special characters wherever possible and only use alphanumeric.

# Resource list

Below here is a table which sets out naming for all resources listed by Microsoft’s guidance to date.  Pseudocode is used in this table where names are represented with `${}` describing a value which is not an explict string, so watch out for those. These can sometimes be things descriptors such as the optional outfix or to give flexibility in naming things more appropriately than strict numbering.  Another note is regarding resource limit,  we have attempted to migrate all data from [Microsoft's guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md) into a single table, but its worth checking out the Microsoft version too, there is a copy of it [here](https://github.com/libre-devops/azure-naming-convention/ms-resource-limits.md).
